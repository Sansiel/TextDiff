I’m going to assume at first that you’re using Microsoft Visual Studio, Community Edition. This includes an excellent C++ compiler—it’s powerful, fast, and has nearly all of the up-to-date features. However, the Microsoft compiler raises some special issues, and one of the purposes of this chapter is to acquaint you with those issues so you can successfully use C++.

If you’re not using this compiler, skip ahead to the section, “If You’re Not Using Microsoft.”

I’ll get into the more abstract aspects of C++ later, but first let’s get that compiler installed.

Install Microsoft Visual Studio
Even if you have an older version of Microsoft Visual Studio, you should consider updating to the current Community Edition, because it has nearly all the up-to-date features presented in this book. If you’re already running Enterprise Edition, congratulations, but make sure it’s up to date.

Here are the steps for installing Microsoft Visual Studio Community Edition:

If all goes well, Microsoft Visual Studio, which includes the Microsoft C++ compiler, should be installed on your computer, and you’re ready to start programming. First, however, you need to create a project
Create a Project with Microsoft
There are some files and settings you need for even the simplest program, but Visual Studio puts all the items you need into something called a project.

With Visual Studio, Microsoft makes things easy by providing everything you need when you create a project. Note that you will need to create a new project for each program you work on.

So let’s create a project.
