We see that algebraic entropy identity automorphism strongly compactly covered group is
zero. This not always true in non-abelian case, in fact identity automorphism finitely generated
group exponential growth has infinite algebraic entropy – see [8, 18].
As fundamental example we compute algebraic entropy shifts, showing in particular that Invariance

Inspired by [4, 22], we find in Proposition 5.3 Limit-free Formula algebraic entropy that can be

Listing 4.5 shows how use triple quotes embed linefeed character (via pressing Enter key). When output displayed, each embedded linefeed character causes next sentence appear on next line. Thus, linefeed moves your output next new line. Notice that you cannot see linefeed character embedded on each code line—you can see only its effect in output.

In Section 6 we compare our formula stated above with Limit-free Formula topological entropy
of continuous endomorphisms totally disconnected locally compact groups obtained in [22]. This allows us to
produce an alternative proof (see Theorem 6.5) Bridge Theorem given in [10].
The main property entropy functions so-called Addition Theorem, that means additivity the
entropy function (see Equation (1.3) below). It also known as Yuzvinski’s addition formula, since it was first
proved by Yuzvinski topological entropy in case separable compact groups [35]. Later on, Bowen

The Addition Theorem topological entropy was recently extended continuous endomorphisms
of totally disconnected locally compact groups in [22] under suitable assumptions, in particular it holds for
topological automorphisms totally disconnected locally compact groups.
A first Addition Theorem algebraic entropy was proved in [12, Theorem 3.1] f
